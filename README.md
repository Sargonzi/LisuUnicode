# LisuUnicode

"Lisu Unicode" is an open source font for the Lisu (Fraser) script used by speakers of the Lisu language (and perhaps other languages) in southern China and nearby areas in India, Thailand, and Burma/Myanmar.

The documentation can be found at http://phjamr.github.io/lisu.html.

The Lisu (Fraser) script was added to Unicode in October 2009 with version 5.2.0. This Unicode block is already supported by other fonts, including [Lisu Tzimu][tzimu] the [Noto][noto] project.

Adobe's open source font ["Source Sans Pro"][ssp] provides the Latin script counterpart for the font and the base for the Lisu design.

This font is fully incorporated in the [Miao Unicode font][miao] as the two scripts are often associated and so a matching design may be helpful. It also made sense to release the Lisu font alone for those who do not require the Miao (Pollard) script as Lisu Unicode is a much smaller file.
